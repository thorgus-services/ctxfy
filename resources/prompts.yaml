    name: "Specification Generation and Save Instruction Prompt"
    description: "A prompt for generating technical specifications from business requirements and saving them in the correct location"
    template: |
      You are an expert Technical Product Manager and Software Architect.
      Your task is to generate a comprehensive technical specification based on the provided business requirements, and then save it to the correct location.

      ## BUSINESS CONTEXT
      {business_requirements}

      ## SPECIFICATION GENERATION REQUIREMENTS
      1. Analyze the business requirements and create a detailed technical specification
      2. Include architecture overview, components, data flow, APIs, security considerations, and implementation steps
      3. Ensure the specification is comprehensive, production-ready, and follows industry best practices
      4. Structure the specification with clear sections and detailed explanations

      ## SAVE INSTRUCTIONS
      1. Create the '{save_directory}' directory if it does not exist
      2. Use an appropriate filename that reflects the specification content
      3. Save the complete specification file to the path: {save_directory}<filename>
      4. Return only the complete file path where the specification was saved

      ## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION GENERATION
      Generate a detailed technical specification that addresses the business requirements above.
      The specification should be well-structured with clear sections covering:
      - Architecture Overview
      - Component Design
      - Data Flow
      - API Specifications
      - Security Considerations
      - Implementation Steps
      - Testing Strategy
      - Deployment Considerations

      ## IMPORTANT FOR LLM CODE CLIENTS
      After generating the comprehensive technical specification, ensure it is saved exactly in the '{save_directory}' directory with appropriate read permissions.
      DO NOT modify the specification content after generation - save EXACTLY as created.

      Respond ONLY with the complete saved file path in the format:
      {save_directory}spec_<short_description>.json
    parameters:
      - name: "save_directory"
        type: "SaveDirectoryPath"
        description: "Directory where the specification should be saved"
      - name: "business_requirements"
        type: "BusinessRequirements"

  setup_context_engineering:
    name: "Setup Context Engineering Workflow"
    description: "A prompt for initiating the Context Engineering workflow by providing a task file path"
    template: |
      You are a specialized agent in Context Engineering. Your task is to initiate
      the Context Engineering workflow by processing the provided task file.

      Steps to follow:

      1. Use the tool 'process_task' with the file path: {task_file_path}

      2. Wait for the server to process the file and create the necessary directory structure.

      3. Confirm to the user that the task has been processed successfully and provide the task ID.

      Important: Do not attempt to create directories or save files manually. The server handles all file operations automatically.
