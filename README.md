> **Documentation tools describe what code does. Ctxfy engineers why it should exist and how it evolves.**

Ctxfy is a CLI tool that transforms business requirements into high-quality code through **Context Engineering** - not just generating code, but engineering the context that makes code emerge naturally.

## ✨ Why Ctxfy is Different?

- **Engineered Context, Not Just Prompts**: We create structured context stacks, not just random prompts
- **Full Workspace Awareness**: Complete access to your code, architecture, and existing patterns
- **Quality-First Workflow**: 9 rigorous validation steps before code delivery
- **Zero Cost**: Native integration with Qwen Code using OAuth (2,000 free requests/day)
- **IDE Agnostic**: Works in any terminal, no plugins required

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

```bash
pip install ctxfy
```

### Quick Start

```bash
ctxfy init
ctxfy workflow --task "Your first task"
```

## 🌟 The Ctxfy Flow (7 Steps)

1. **Analyze** → Breaks complex tasks into manageable subtasks
2. **PRP Base** → Translates business requirements to technical specifications
3. **Context Stack** → Creates complete context stack (system, domain, task)
4. **Validate** → Rigorous validation of context stack
5. **PRP Backend** → Details technical specifications for implementation
6. **Execute** → Implements code with complete workspace context
7. **Code Review** → Automated review based on quality criteria

## 🛠️ Usage

### Initialize a Project
```bash
ctxfy init
```

### Run a Workflow
```bash
ctxfy workflow --task "Implement user authentication"
```

### Additional Commands
```bash
ctxfy --help          # Show all available commands
ctxfy config          # Manage configuration
ctxfy context         # Work with context stacks
```
