📝 Implementation Notes
Usage Guidelines
1. This template facilitates translation from business language to technical specifications
2. Fill all sections completely for complex requirements
3. For simple requirements, focus on Technical Objective and Key Technical Decisions
4. Always validate with stakeholders before proceeding to implementation
5. Keep a version history of changes to requirements

Adaptation Rules
- For agile environments, focus on the acceptance criteria and capabilities
- For regulated environments, emphasize compliance and validation sections
- For research projects, expand the technical constraints and architecture considerations
- Always maintain traceability between business requirements and technical components
